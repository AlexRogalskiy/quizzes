# the number divided by 1 to 10 can be achieved multiplying its factors
1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10=3628800
# but inside this factor there are some repetitions, like 2 and 5 and 10 (2*5=10), so we can remove them and last the following factors
5*7*8*9=2520

# from 1 to 20 goes like this
19=ok
18=2*9
17=ok
16=2*8
15=3*5
14=2*7
13=ok
12=2*6
11=ok
10=2*5
9=3*3
5*7*8*9*11*13*17*19=116396280
5*7*9*11*13*16*17*19=232792560
